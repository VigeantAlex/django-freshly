Django Freshly
====================

A Django application that enables your server to remotely trigger a client-side asset reload.

**Author:** Val Neekman, [ info@neekware.com, @vneekman]


Overview
========

Django ``Freshly`` empowers your server in triggering assets reload (refresh) by
automatically versioning your assets as per your settings directives.

When you change an asset, whether be an .mpg, .png or a pdf file, simply up your
asset version number in your settings file and reload your server. ``Freshly`` will append a
new version number to all your assets which in turn triggers the client(s) to download a `fresh`
copy of your assets.

This application is a perfect companion to your stack specially if your static content is served from
a Content Delivery Network (CDN) such as CloudFront. You can just set the `Cache-Control` to its max and
manage your assets caching via `freshly`.


How to install
==================
    
    **Install**
    1. easy_install django-freshly
    2. pip install django-freshly
    3. git clone http://github.com/un33k/django-freshly
        a. cd django-freshly
        b. run python setup.py
    4. wget https://github.com/un33k/django-freshly/zipball/master
        a. unzip the downloaded file
        b. cd into django-freshly-* directory
        c. run python setup.py

How to use
=================

Include freshly middleware somewhere towards the end of your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`.

   ```python
   MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
        'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
        'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',
        '..............',

        # the last middleware perhaps
        'freshly.middleware.assets.AssetVersioningMiddleware',
   ] 
   ```


Decide which assets needs to be version controlled:

   ```python
   # Note that assets with the following extensions will be versioned by default:

   [
        'jpg','jpeg','gif','css','png','js','ico',
        'pdf','doc','docx','ppt','pptx','txt','mov',
        'mp4','mpeg','mp3','swf',
   ]
   ```
   
   ```python
   # You can overwrite the defaults via the ``FRESHLY_ASSETS_EXTENTIONS`` in your settings file.

    FRESHLY_ASSETS_EXTENTIONS = ['my', 'own', 'ext', 'over', 'write', 'the', 'default', 'ones',] # Example ONLY
   ```
   
   ```python
   # Or append your extensions to the default extensions via ``FRESHLY_ASSETS_EXTENTIONS_EXTRA`` in your settings file.
    FRESHLY_ASSETS_EXTENTIONS_EXTRA = ['my', 'own', 'ext', 'plus', 'the', 'default', 'ones',] # Example ONLY
   ```

Choose a versioning pattern:

   ```python
   # You can choose any pattern via ``FRESHLY_ASSETS_VERSION`` in your settings file.
   # Examples:

    FRESHLY_ASSETS_VERSION = 'v001' # OR
    FRESHLY_ASSETS_VERSION = 'ver1' # OR
    FRESHLY_ASSETS_VERSION = 'version_01' # Etc.
   ```

During the development:

   ```python
    # You may want to have a fresh copy of your .css, .js downloaded by your browser during the development
    # You can do so via ``FRESHLY_ASSETS_ALWAYS_FRESH`` in your settings file.
    # Examples:

    FRESHLY_ASSETS_ALWAYS_FRESH = True # OR
    FRESHLY_ASSETS_ALWAYS_FRESH = DEBUG
   ```



Performance:
=================
While this process may consumes some minimal CPU cycles, the fact that it's doing it without 
any complications to your code-space, should be a good reason for you to consider this app.

The application is a perfect tool for the front-end designers during the development.             
``Freshly`` ensures that designer sees the result of his/her changes immediately without constantly
hitting the browser's refresh button. 


Running the tests
=================

To run the tests against the current environment:

    python manage.py test freshly # ToDo
